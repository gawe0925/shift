Purpose
I currently work at a pharmacy, where the manager still manually creates shift schedules using Excel.
I realized there should be a faster and more automated solution — so I built Shift to address that real-world pain point.

Although there are many existing scheduling apps, I wanted to create my own version from scratch, both to solve a real problem and to gain experience in full-stack and cloud deployment.
The React frontend was generated and iteratively refined with AI assistance, allowing me to explore how AI can accelerate modern web development.
